### December 1st, 2017

Here are the Blockmason Dev Updates for December 1st:

#### Credit Protocol Update
We switched from having users confirm transactions directly with the smart contract, to having them sign the transactions so that any 3rd party could submit them (only if the signatures were valid). This update to the CP contract was deployed today.

#### Lndr Update
Transactions are now signed and submitted to the server, which sends them to the blockchain, retrying if necessary. This means that from the user's perspective, debt confirmation is instant.
