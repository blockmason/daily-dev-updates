Happy Thanksgiving!

This is our first dev update from Blockmason and we hope it finds you well. We have been working hard to release Lndr, our first
dapp built on top of the Credit Protocol. We have also been documenting both CP and our dapp architecture to empower the community
to build on top of CP and create any and every kind of dapp.

#### Lndr Updates

Lndr is getting ever closer to it's release, and today the team resolved some issues with the overly slow account creation
process on Android while also cleaning up the UX. We have successfully built an APK and will be releasing the alpha soon! In the
meantime, you can subscribe for updates at lndr.io and we will keep you posted on the progress.

#### Documentation Updates

We have laid out how our team approaches dapp architecture, how to CP works, and how to build on top of CP. We will be releasing
this documentation as a series of blog posts and you can find all of the documentation (include in-progress docs), along with example contracts,
tests, and more in this repo: https://github.com/blockmason/dapp-tech-guides
